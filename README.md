Setting up a time-based trigger to run your syncCalendarEvents() function periodically is a great way to keep your calendar automatically synchronized. Here's how you can set it up in Google Apps Script:

Open your Google Apps Script project where your syncCalendarEvents() function is located.
In the Apps Script editor, click on the clock icon on the left sidebar. This icon represents "Triggers".
If you don't see the clock icon, you can also go to "Edit" > "Current project's triggers" in the menu bar.
In the Triggers page, click the "+ Add Trigger" button at the bottom right corner of the page.
In the "Add Trigger" dialog that appears, set up the trigger with the following settings:

Choose which function to run: syncCalendarEvents
Choose which deployment should run: Head
Select event source: Time-driven
Select type of time based trigger: This depends on how often you want the sync to occur. You can choose:

Minutes timer: Runs every n minutes
Hour timer: Runs every hour
Day timer: Runs once a day
Week timer: Runs once a week
Month timer: Runs once a month


Select time of day: If you chose Day, Week, or Month timer, you can specify the time of day it should run.


Click "Save" to create the trigger.

For example, if you want the script to run daily at 1:00 AM, you would choose:

Select type of time based trigger: Day timer
Select time of day: 1am to 2am

After setting up the trigger, Google Apps Script will automatically run your syncCalendarEvents() function at the specified intervals.
A few things to keep in mind:

Make sure your script has the necessary authorizations. The first time it runs automatically, it may fail if it hasn't been authorized to access your calendar and fetch the iCal URL.
Google has quotas and limitations on script runtime and frequency. If your script is processing a large number of events, you might need to be mindful of these limits.
You can create multiple triggers if you need more complex scheduling.
You can always come back to the Triggers page to modify or delete the trigger if you need to change the schedule or stop the automatic syncing.

By setting up this time-based trigger, your calendar will stay synchronized without you having to manually run the script each time. The frequency you choose should depend on how often your iCal feed is updated and how quickly you need those updates reflected in your Google Calendar.
